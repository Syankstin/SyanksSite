        <p>The horror genre surely can give the developers a whole lot of creative freedom. Especially, when the key points of the horror game are immersion and the ability of direct interaction 
          with environment. They can achieve said immersion by, at least, positioning the camera inside the playable character’s eyes – the main character, who would be called by us, players, 
          the connector between the real world and the world presented in the game. Of course, the developers can achieve the immersion especially with virtual reality, but... from 2012 to 2016 VR games
          were relatively small when compared to typical games for consoles and PC. Since 2017 the bigger games were coming, for example <em>Resident Evil VII: Biohazard</em> from day one was compatible 
          with, at least, PlayStation VR. But today we won’t be talking about <em>RE7</em>, but something a lot smaller. Today we’ll talk about the small indie horror game from Polish studio bloober team 
          called <em>Layers of Fear</em>.<br>
        <em>Layers of Fear</em> starts off with the main character returning home from the court hearing. After that, he wants to start creating his magnum opus. Because of that, our main character walks 
          through various hallways and rooms of his home in search of inspiration. And that’s where the player plays his part in the story of this game which... 
          is told in a convoluted way, if I’m being honest.</p>
